  <div>[Intro Refrain]</br>
    This fire grows higher </br>
    This fire grows higher </br>
    This fire grows higher </br>
    This fire grows higher </br>
    <hr>
    [Verse 1]</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart</br>
    An endless yearning in your heart</br>
    Build it bigger than the sun</br>
    Let it grow, let it grow</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart</br>
    Don't be alarmed</br>
    <hr>
    [Refrain]</br>
    This fire grows higher</br>
    <hr>
    [Verse 2]</br>
    When there's a doubt within your mind</br>
    Because you're thinking all the time</br>
    Framing rights into wrongs</br>
    Move along, move along</br>
    When there's a doubt within your mind</br>
    <hr>
    [Verse 3]</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart</br>
    And you think it'll burst apart</br>
    Or there's nothing to fear</br>
    Save the tears, save the tears</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart</br>
    <hr>
    <p id="FavLine"><mark>[Bridge]</br>
    And if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born</br>
    Then it's time to go</br>
    And define your destination</br>
    There's so many different places to call home</br>
    Because when you find yourself the villain in the story you have written</br>
    It's plain to see</br>
    That sometimes the best intentions are in need of redemptions</br>
    Would you agree?</br>
    If so please show me</mark</p></br>
    <hr>
    [Refrain]</br>
    This fire grows higher</br>
    This fire grows higher</br>
    <hr>
    [Outro (with Refrain)]</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher)</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher. This fire grows higher)</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher. This fire grows higher)</br>
    When there's a burning in your heart...</div>
